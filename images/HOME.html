				  <p id="edit">Global warming is the long-term rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system.<br> It is a major aspect of climate change, and has been demonstrated by direct temperature measurements and by measurements of various effects of the warming.<br>The terms global warming and climate change are often used interchangeably.<br> However, speaking more accurately, global warming denotes the mainly human-caused increase in global surface temperatures and its <br>projected continuation, but climate change includes both global warming and its effects, such as changes in precipitation. <br>While there have been prehistoric periods of global warming,many observed changes since the mid-20th century have been unprecedented over decades to millennia.</p>

					<h2 id="edith2" style="font-size: 30px;"><u>Causes of Global Warming</u></h2><br>
					<p id="edit" style="text-align: center;"> Global warming occurs when carbon dioxide (CO2) and other air pollutants and greenhouse gases collect in the atmosphere and absorb sunlight and solar radiation that have bounced off the earth’s surface.<br> Normally, this radiation would escape into space—but these pollutants, which can last for years to centuries in the atmosphere, trap the heat and cause the planet to get hotter. That's what's known as the greenhouse effect.<br><br></p>

						<p id="edit" style="text-align: center;">In the United States, the burning of fossil fuels to make electricity is the largest source of heat-trapping pollution, producing about two billion tons of CO2 every year.Coal-burning power plants are by far the biggest polluters. The country’s second-largest source of carbon pollution is the transportation sector, which generates about 1.7 billion tons of CO2 emissions a year.</p>

							<h2 id="col" style="font-size: 30px;"><u>Effects Of Global warming </u></h2><br>
							
									<p id="edit">Predicting  the  consequences of  global  warming  is one  of  the  most  difficult  tasks  faced  by  the  climate researchers. This is due to the fact that natural processes that cause rain, snowfall, hailstorms, rise in sea levels is reliant  on  many diverse  factors.  Moreover,  it  is very hard  to  predict  the  size  of  emissions  of  greenhouse gases in the future  years as this is determined majorly through  technological  advancements  and  political decisions.  Global  warming  produces  many  negative effects some of which are described here. Firstly, extra water vapour  which is  present in  the atmosphere  falls again as rain which leads to floods in various regions of the world. When the weather turns warmer, evaporation process  from  both  land  and  sea  rises.  This  leads  to drought  in  the  regions  where  increased  evaporation process is  not compensated by increased  precipitation. In  some  areas  of  the  world,  this  will  result  in  crop failure  and  famine  particularly  in  areas  where  the temperatures are  already high. The  extra water vapour content in  the atmosphere  will fall again as extra  rain hence  causing  flood.  Towns  and  villages  which  are dependent on the melting water from snowy mountains may suffer drought  and scarcity  of water  supply. It is because the glaciers all over the world are shrinking at a very rapid rate and  melting of ice appears  to be  faster than  previously  projected.</p>
									
<br>
									<p id="edit"> According  to Intergovernmental  Panel  on  Climate  Change  (IPCC), about  one-sixth  of  the  total  population  of  the  world lives  in  the  regions  which  shall  be  affected  by  a decrease  in  melting  water.  The  warmer  climate  will likely cause more heat waves, more violent rainfall and also  amplification  in  the  severity  of  hailstorms  and thunderstorms. Rising  of sea levels  is the most  deadly affect  of  global  warming,  the  rise  in  temperature  is causing the ice  and glaciers  to melt rapidly.  This will lead to rise of  water levels  in oceans, rivers  and lakes that can pilot devastation in the form of floods. Temperature anomalies are projected to  increase in coming years.  Before, the 20th century,  the  situation  was well  under  control but  the beginning of the current century, the situation started to worsen .This was all due to increase in global warming majorly due  to the fact that  new industries  and power houses  started  operation  and  emitted  harmful  gases which cause the planet to heat up. We are  currently experiencing  severity of extreme  climate events  in the  form  of thunderstorms, floods  and  earthquakes.  This  destruction  will  take  a sharp hike if nothing is done to stop this menace.  How  will we survive  on earth given the rise in temperature to prevail?</p></div>

											<p style="color: white; ">In 1895, Svante Arrhenius first calculated the impact that increasing carbon dioxide could have on Earth’s temperature. Since then, scientists have further refined their understanding of the greenhouse effect and the role our rising carbon emissions are having on it.</p><br>

										  <p id="edit" style="font-family:&#39;Times New Roman&#39;, Times, serif;">Mitigation of and adaptation to climate change are two complementary responses to global warming. Successful adaptation is easier if there are substantial emission reductions. Many of the countries that have contributed least to global greenhouse gas emissions are among the most vulnerable to climate change, which raises questions about justice and fairness with regard to mitigation and adaptation.</p><br>
										  
											  <h3 id="ed3"> 1.Mitigation</h3><br><br>
											  <p id="edit" style="font-family: cursive;">Climate change can be mitigated through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions or the enhancement of the capacity of carbon sinks to absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. There is a large potential for future reductions in emissions by a combination of activities, including energy conservation and increased energy efficiency; the use of low-carbon energy technologies, such as renewable energy, nuclear energy, and carbon capture and storage; decarbonizing buildings and transport; and enhancing carbon sinks through, for example, reforestation and preventing deforestation. A 2015 report by Citibank concluded that transitioning to a low-carbon economy would yield a positive return on investments.</p><br>
										  <h3 id="ed3">2.Adaptation</h3><br><br>
											  <p id="edit" style="font-family: cursive;">Climate change adaptation is "the adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climatic stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities." Examples of adaptation are improved coastline protection, better disaster management, and the development of more resistant crops. The adaptation may be planned, either in reaction to or anticipation of global warming, or spontaneous, i.e. without government intervention.<br><br>
				  
													  The public sector, private sector, and communities are all gaining experience with adaptation, and adaptation is becoming embedded within certain planning processes.While some adaptation responses call for trade-offs, others bring synergies and co-benefits.Environmental organizations and public figures have emphasized changes in the climate and the risks they entail, while promoting adaptation to changes in infrastructural needs and emissions reductions.<br><br>
													  
													  Adaptation is especially important in developing countries since they are predicted to bear the brunt of the effects of global warming.The capacity and potential for humans to adapt, called adaptive capacity, is unevenly distributed across different regions and populations, and developing countries generally have less capacity to adapt.In June 2019, U.N. special rapporteur Philip Alston warned of a "climate apartheid" situation developing, where global warming "could push more than 120 million more people into poverty by 2030 and will have the most severe impact in poor countries, regions, and the places poor people live and work"</p><br>
													  <h3 id="ed3">3.Climate engineering</h3><br><br>
													  <p id="edit" style="font-family: cursive;">Climate engineering (sometimes called geoengineering or climate intervention) is the deliberate modification of the climate. It has been investigated as a possible response to global warming by groups including NASA and the Royal Society.Techniques studied fall generally into the categories of solar radiation management and carbon dioxide removal, although various other schemes have been suggested. A study from 2014 investigated the most common climate engineering methods and concluded that they are either ineffective or have potentially severe side effects and cannot be stopped without causing rapid climate change.</p>
